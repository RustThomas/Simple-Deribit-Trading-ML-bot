# Simple-Deribit-Trading-ML-bot
Simple implementation of an automated trading bot on Deribit that uses a model to predict price direction then open and closes orders.

This bot was profitable during a testing period of a few days in october 2025. However, manual trading proved to generate larger profits. 
Significant tuning and changes are likely needed, including model, data and covariates. 

The code of this project is absolutely not guaranteed to be profitable. 

#Using
To use, you need to generate an API key on deribit and then replace client_id and client_secret with yours. 
You may switch to Deribit testing environment to experiment before going live.

Them, simply run it.
